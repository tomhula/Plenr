- Authentication/Authorization
- Server exception encapsulation
- Use better authentication (JWT?)
- Fix initial /login route not showing in the address bar
- Handle authentication cases. Token not being valid anymore. Basically some call failing due to invalid auth token, so authentication challenge should happen again.
- Add possibility to log-out.
- Add localisation
- Make sure the navigation stack actually is how it should be (go back pops and does not add)
